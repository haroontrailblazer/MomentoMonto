## Overview

**MomentoMonto** is a server monitoring and response time analysis tool designed to **track, analyze, and visualize** the performance of web servers in real-time.  
It helps **developers**, **system administrators**, and **network engineers** ensure high **availability**, **stability**, and **speed** of their online services.

---

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously checks server uptime and performance.  
- **Response Time Tracking:** Measures latency and displays detailed analysis.  
- **Uptime Visualization:** View server stability through charts and metrics.  
- **Multi-Server Support:** Monitor multiple endpoints simultaneously.  
- **Smart Alerts (optional):** Detect downtime or slow responses automatically.  
- **Modern UI:** Interactive Streamlit dashboard for easy data visualization.

---

## Architecture & Workflow

MomentoMonto uses **Python** and **Streamlit** to periodically send HTTP requests to the configured servers and record:
- Response time (in milliseconds)  
- Server availability (Up/Down status)  
- Request timestamps  

The collected data is visualized with charts and response trends for intuitive performance tracking.
